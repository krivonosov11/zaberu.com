        <p>
            A single London bus journey costs £1.50 no matter how far you go (unlike the Tube zone fare system). You can
            even take multiple buses within one hour at no extra charge thanks to the Hopper fare system. Plus, no
            matter how many buses or trams you take, it will never cost you more than £4.50 a day. Just make sure you
            use the same payment option across every journey.

            For contactless payment cards issued outside the UK, it's
            best to check with your card issuer as transaction fees or bank charges may apply.

            Paying your fare is very
            easy - simply touch your payment card of choice on the yellow card reader as you board the bus, or show the
            driver your paper Travelcard. To avoid card clash, make sure to only touch one card on the yellow reader,
            and to keep your other cards separate.

            If you don’t have enough credit on your Visitor Oyster card or Oyster
            card, you will be able to make one more journey on a bus before needing to top up.
